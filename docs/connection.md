## Connect to your Galaxy server and register

Each student will work with his own Galaxy server account.
The URL of your Galaxy server is available in this [table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SKZW_moNWRxOe96ywyU8thaUWIyTc8mg6cA3jknvURU/edit?usp=sharing)

As soon as you reach the Galaxy server home page, register for a new account:

- menu "Authenticate and Register"
- --> register
- Put an email address, a password and a user name (in small case), and remember them.
- You will be redirected to your newly created account
